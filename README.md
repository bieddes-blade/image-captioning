# image-captioning-project

This notebook contains training of an image-to-caption model that can produce descriptions for real world images. The model architecture, a CNN encoder and an RNN decoder, is based on the ideas from this blog post written by Google Research Scientists Oriol Vinyals, Alexander Toshev, Samy Bengio, and Dumitru Erhan.
